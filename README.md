# email-slicer
A mini Python project using regular expressions, or regex, that extracts emails from a file, and prints them along with the username and domain of each email.

I have provided a sample file to test the code, 'mbox.txt'.

 This program can be used for various purposes, like data analysis, marketing campaigns, and user identification.
